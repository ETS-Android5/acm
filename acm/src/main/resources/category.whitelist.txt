# Allows selecting which categories to make available to the ACM user. Messages may only be assigned to
# those categories; any messages already in another category will continue to show those other categories.
#
# This file can define an excludelist and/or an includelist.
# To place a category into an includelist, simply list the category id, one per line.
# To place a category into an excludelist, list the category id, preceeded by '!', '~', or '-' on the line.
#
# The includelist and excludelist, and the taxonomy property 'nonassignable' govern which categories
# are shown in the category pane in the ACM.
#
# The determination of whether to show a category is made as follows:
#  - If the category is 'nonAssignable', it is not visible.
#  - If the category's id is excludelisted, it is not visible.
#  - If there is an includelist, then:
#  --  If the category's id is in the includelist, it is visible.
#  --  If the category has a parent, and the parent is visible, it is visible (by inheritance).
#  --  Otherwise the category is not visible.
#  - Otherwise there is no includelist, and:
#  --  If the category has a parent, it inherits the parent's visibility.
#  --  Otherwise this is the root category, and it is visible.
#
# Note that any child categories of a 'nonAssignable' category are not shown, either.
#
# Blank lines are ignored. The '#' character introduces a comment, which is ignored. Leading and
# trailing spaces are ignored.
#
# Examples:
# Hide "Categorized Feedback":
# ! 90   # Categorized Feedback
# Show only "Health":
# 2      # Health
# Show "Agriculture", but hide "Fish":
# 1      # Agriculture
# ~ 1-5  # Fish
#
# The root category id is 'LB_TAX_1.0'. This is only useful or necessary if you wish to exclude
# some category, then include (ie, un-exclude) a child within that category. In that case, the
# presence of the includelist will cause everything to be hidden, unless you also include the root.
#
# LB_TAX_1.0  # Taxonomy root
# ~ 90        # Categorized Feedback (excluded)
# 90-13       # Hand Washing (re-included)
#
# Place include / exclude items here. Please comment groups and individual categories.
