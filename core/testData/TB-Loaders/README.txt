This is a "dehydrated" version of an unpacked deployment.

Most of the files have been replaced with small amrker files. The contents of 
each file is a number, starting with 1001, and is different in each file. 
Thus it is possible to determine if the correct "10.a18" file has been copied.

The few that remain are the control and metadata files.
